**CodeSpark Hackathon: Dynamic Animated Portfolio**
This project is a submission for the "HTML+CSS" challenge in the CodeSpark Hackathon. It is a modern, fully responsive, single-page portfolio website designed to showcase skills and projects with a strong emphasis on UI/UX, creativity, and advanced CSS animations.


1. Creativity & Originality
Advanced CSS Animations: The entire page is filled with custom animations, from subtle background glows and floating elements to interactive hover effects and animated gradients on text and borders.

Modern Design: The project adopts a professional, dark-mode theme popular in tech portfolios, using a gradient background and a vibrant accent color to create a memorable look.

2. Functionality
Fully Responsive: The layout seamlessly adapts to all screen sizes, from large desktops to mobile phones, ensuring a perfect user experience on any device.

Interactive Elements: All navigation links, social media icons, and buttons are fully functional. The "Download Resume" button is configured to provide a user's CV.

3. UI/UX Design
Visual Hierarchy: A clean structure, professional typography (using Google Fonts), and generous spacing guide the user's eye through the content logically.

User Feedback: Hover effects on all interactive elements (buttons, links, cards) provide clear visual feedback, enhancing usability.

Engaging Experience: The animations are designed to be engaging without being distracting, making the experience of browsing the portfolio enjoyable.

4. Extra Effort
The "Extra Effort" for this project is clearly demonstrated through the extensive use of advanced CSS techniques:

Keyframe Animations: Dozens of custom @keyframes were created for effects like floating cards (cardFloat), glowing text (titleGlow), animated borders (borderGradient), and interactive shines (progressShine).

Pseudo-elements: Used ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to create non-intrusive animated underlines and hover effects.

Complex Selectors: Advanced CSS selectors were used to style elements precisely without needing excessive classes.

Hosted Assets: All assets like fonts and icons are linked from reliable CDNs (Google Fonts, Font Awesome).

Technology Stack
HTML5: For semantic and well-structured content.

CSS3: For all styling, layout, responsiveness, and advanced animations.

Google Fonts (Inter): For clean and professional typography.

Font Awesome: For high-quality, scalable icons.
